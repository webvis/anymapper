# anymapper
### Visualize your data as a zoomable map

*anymapper* is a collection of [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/) UI components for building [Zoomable User Interfaces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zooming_user_interface). You can use it to provide a familiar, Google Maps-like user interface for navigating [SVG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalable_Vector_Graphics) vector graphics, such as schematic diagrams, abstract visualizations, representations of gardens, shopping centers, multi-storey buildings, etc.

*anymapper* follows a quite literal interpretation of Ben Shneiderman's [Visual Information-Seeking Mantra](https://infovis-wiki.net/wiki/Visual_Information-Seeking_Mantra), enabling the structuring of your information as a graphical overview from which to load more detailed content as the user zooms in or selects regions of interest.
